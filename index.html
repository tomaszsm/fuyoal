    <h2><a name="about">About Fuyoal</a></h2>

    <p>In many countries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law">key disclosure law</a> requires
      individuals to reveal their encryption keys to police and other law enforcement agencies. Refusal can lead to
      serious measures taken against individual. One way to avoid this constraint is to make it impossible to proof that
      the concealed content exists at all.</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deniable_encryption">Deniable encryption</a> refers to a situation when
      adversary can not prove that concealed content exists. Most commonly discussed form of deniable encryption
      is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography">steganography</a>. This technique fits for some uses but
      is not adequate for general purposes. Firstly because it usually takes much larger content to hide the target
      one. Secondly because plain steganography dos not
      fulfill <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_principle">Kerckhoffs's principle</a>.</p>

    <p>More versatile deniable encryption tools include low level hiding techniques like creating multiple encrypted
      disk volumes within a container volume. These tools are difficult to use in portable form or in general without
      deep integration with computer operational system. Fuyoal is software which allows encryption of confidential
      content jointly with facade content that user is inclined to reveal. As the software can also be used to encrypt
      single content the adversary is not able to proof existence of concealed subject.</p>

    <h3><a name="usagecli">Command Line Interface</a></h3>
    
    <p>Fuyoal is to be used as follows:</p>
    <pre>
    Usage:
      fuyoal -h
      fuyoal -e file1 key1 [-s size] | [file2 key2]
      fuyoal -d file key1 | key2
    
    Options:
      -h        Shows help message
      -e        Ensrypts file1 with key1 and possibly file2 with key2
      -s        Specify size of phony second file (in bytes)
      -d        Decrypts file with key
    </pre>

    <p>Details:</p>

    <pre>fuyoal -h</pre>
    <p>displays help message presented above.</p>

    <pre>fuyoal -e file1 key1</pre>
    <p>encrypts <i>file1</i> with <i>key1</i> and adds random part to make it impossible to discriminate this case from
      case when two files are encrypted together. The size of the phony part is drawn from truncated normal distribution
      with mean equal size of <i>file1</i>, standard deviation equal 10% of size of <i>file1</i> and range equal 60% of
      size of <i>file1</i>. The output is saved to file <i>file1</i>.fya.</p>

    <pre>fuyoal -e file1 key1 -s size</pre>
    <p>encrypts <i>file1</i> with <i>key1</i> and adds random part to make it impossible to discriminate this case from
      case when two files are encrypted together. The size of the phony part is specified by <i>size</i> parameter in
      bytes. The output is saved to file <i>file1</i>.fya.</p>
    
    <pre>fuyoal -e file1 key1 file2 key2</pre>
    <p>encrypts <i>file1</i> with <i>key1</i> and <i>file2</i> with <i>key2</i>. The output is saved to
      file <i>file1</i>.fya.</p>

    <pre>fuyoal -d file key1</pre>
    <p>decrypts first (when two files were encrypted together) or only file (when just one file was encrypted).</p>

    <pre>fuyoal -d file key2</pre>
    <p>decrypts second (hidden) file (when two files were encrypted together).</p>

    <p>Using GUI version of the program is pretty self explanatory.</p>
